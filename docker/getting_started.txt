# Step1
docker run --name repo alpine/git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started.git

[The Getting Started project is a simple GitHub repository which contains everything you need to build an image and run it as a container.]

# Step2
docker cp repo:/git/getting-started/ .
cd getting-started

[A Docker image is a private file system just for your container. It provides all the files and code your container needs.]

# Step3
docker build -t docker101tutorial .
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name docker-tutorial docker101tutorial

[Start a container based on the image you built in the previous step. Running a container launches your application with private resources, securely isolated from the rest of your machine.]

# Step4
docker tag docker101tutorial bya2/docker101tutorial
docker push bya2/docker101tutorial

[Save and share your image on Docker Hub to enable other users to easily download and run the image on any destination machine.]
